Recently, I watched a video discussing the Universe, and I was captivated by the cosmic splendor, particularly the colorful nebulas and stardust. So, for assignment 4, I aimed to capture a small fragment of the universe. At the very least, I wanted to depict stars and infuse them with captivating features.

To begin, I altered the appearance of the stars because rectangles didn't quite do justice to their beauty. I accomplished this by directly modifying the vertices in the "seagulls.js" file, resulting in each particle taking on a triangular shape. Subsequently, in the vertex shader, I introduced rotation to these particles. I employed their instance number as a parameter to calculate the particles' rotational velocity, resulting in each particle spinning at a unique speed.

In the compute shader, I directed each particle to move towards the center of the canvas. However, as particles approached the center, their speed gradually decreased. Thus, when a particle moved very close to the center point, it almost came to a standstill. Additionally, I established a minimum distance between all particles and the center. If any particle came too close to the center, it would instantly return to its original position, as recorded in the second buffer. This enabled me to create a looping animation: all the stars would converge at the center, pause in position for an extended period, and then orbit the center in a ring formation. After some time, these particles would gradually return to their starting positions and move back towards the center.

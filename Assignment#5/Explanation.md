In this assignment, I have implemented four different types of ants. The first type is the normal one, which is identified by the color orange. Orange ants exhibit specific behaviors: when they cannot detect any pheromones in their current location, they will turn right and leave pheromones behind. On the other hand, if they do encounter pheromones in their current location, they will remove all the pheromones and then turn left.

The second type is the red ant. Red ants will turn left and leave pheromones in their current location if no pheromones are present there. However, if they do find pheromones in their current location, they will take half of the pheromones and then proceed to turn left. Additionally, with each successful pheromone acquisition, this type of ant will gradually become brighter in color.

The third type of ant is represented by the color purple. They behave similarly to the other types when they cannot detect pheromones in their current locationâ€”they simply move to the next position and continue exploring after leaving pheromones. However, if they successfully locate pheromones, their actions differ based on the amount of pheromones they detect. If the pheromone level is above 0.8, they will take half of the pheromones, similar to the second type of ants. But if the pheromone level is less than 0.8, they will subtract 0.1 from it and then turn right.

The final type of ant is the turquoise ant. They don't have any unique behaviors, but they are known for their increased speed. They will keep moving in one direction until they encounter pheromones. Once they do, they will promptly turn right and continue their exploration.

While there are indeed four types of ants, it's worth noting that an ant's type is not set in stone for individual ants. This variability arises from the shared use of the "pheremones[]" array both for recording their types and determining their colors. As a result, it's entirely possible for an ant to transition into a different type if the current level of pheromones meets specific conditions within the compute shader. I find this feature intriguing, which is why I've chosen to retain it. However, if I decide to eliminate this functionality, I might need to introduce a separate read-only buffer to store the type of each ant individually.

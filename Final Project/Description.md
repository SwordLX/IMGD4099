For the final project, I want to try 3D things. I choose making something in Unreal Engine 5.3.

Recently, I watched some pictures recording the scene in the ocean. I was fascinated by the beauty of the lanscape under water. Then, I decided to depict such scene in my final project. For achieving this, I need to implement the boid simulation for my fish, underwater post-processing effect and other decorations.

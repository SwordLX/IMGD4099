This time I use wgsl to implement the simulation of Reaction Diffusion. The idea comes from [this article](https://karlsims.com/rd.html) by Karl Sims. I use two buffers seperately to record the previous state and current state of A and B. In compute shader, there are two functions (laplacianA and laplacianB) used for calculating the difference between the average of nearby grid cells and this cells. Compute shader is responsible for update states of A and B. And here, I add controls for four parameters, including diffusion rate of A(a_Diffusion), diffusion rate of B(b_Diffusion), feed rate(feed) and kill rate(kill). I have limited a_Diffusion and b_Diffusion in a relatively narrow range because I do not want weird results. In addition, the feed rate varies along x axis and the kill rate changes along with y axis. By doing so, I can have some more organic and interesting effects. In fragment shader, I use state of B to draw the resulting shape.

My initial plan is to use Mouse to generate some Bs. Just like as we click mouse in the canvas, there will be some Bs created around the mouse position(the range may like a circle with a small radius). But according to the feedback from my partner, thay did not work, so I just delete it for now.
